mkdir Assign3
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Downloaded the Coreutils from the assignment page and put it in a a dir
called 'Assign3'
Downloaded the GNU keyring to check the signature

There was an error about the trusted signature and not belonging to owner
but it
seems to have downloaded fine


tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
mkdir ~/COInstall

unzip the tar file into the folder Assign3/coreutils-8.29
Created a dir to house the install files

cd coreutils-8.29
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/wahbeh/COInstall

set the make and install files to the directory I made

make
make install

compile the make file and install it to the corresponding directory
compiled successfully, no errors

COInstall/bin/ls -a -A

output: .  ..  bin  libexec  share

reproduced the bug, still shows that -a overrides the -A and displays .
and ..


cd coreutils-8.29
emacs patchFile, paste the patch notes from the Assignment page
patch -p1 < patchFile

put the patch file into the directory. -p1 is used because it is the first
patch
There was a Hunk error displayed but I do not believe anything actually
failed becausethe following steps were successful


make
autoreconf --force --install

It did not work because of the automake warning, so I updated the
configurations


make install
./bin/ls -a -A

output: bin  libexec  share


install the new patch and check to make sure the output is the correct one
now
The Patch Worked!
