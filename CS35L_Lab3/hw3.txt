Assignment 3



1. Does the patch improve performance

         case 'A':
-          if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)
-            ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
+          ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
           break;

From the patch notes, we are getting rid of an if statement, and that is one
less check the computer has to do. So it is slightly faster.

2. What else to watch out for? Might introduce other problems?

./bin/ls -A -a   -output: .  ..  bin  libexec  share
./bin/ls -a -A   -output: bin libexec share

We need to watch out for the order because they output different things.


3. Running randline.py on /dev/null

We get this error: IndexError: list index out of range
The program is trying to choose a line that is not there. 
Similar to picking out an item in an empty error.


4. Running randline.py on /dev/null in Python 3

We get this error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax
It is a compilation error instead of runtime because Python 3 requires
different syntax than Python 2

The line: "except IOError as (errno, strerror):" is incorrect in Python 3.
It should be written as "except IOError as err:
				errno, strerror = err.args"


5. My shuf.py works with both Python 2 and Python 3. I believe this is
because
I did not use any syntax that was strictly for Python 3 such as the
specific exceptions.
