1. man -k word

2. /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   /usr/bin/sh  
   I used which and echo $PATH


3. tr - translate or delete characters
   pr - convert text files for printing
   ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
   
   find /usr/local/cs/bin /usr/bin -executable -name ?r
   man ar, man pr, man tr

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
   used readlink /usr/bin/emacs

5. /usr/bin/gcc version = gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39) (GCC)
   plain gcc version = gcc version 9.2.0 (GCC)
   
   theyre different because the plain gcc is using a different path. 
   It is a completely different executable file entirely

6. u+sx,o-w
   this means that owner gets set and is added the permission to execute
   and other users are removed from writing

7. 
/usr/local/cs
/usr/local/cs/bin
/usr/local/cs/bison-3.4.2
/usr/local/cs/.del
/usr/local/cs/gdb-8.3.1
/usr/local/cs/ocaml-4.09.0


I used man find,  find /usr/local/cs -maxdepth 1 -mtime -28

8. 280
   which find, ls -la /usr/local/cs | grep -c "\->"

9. Dec 28  2013 librom1394.so.0.3.0
   man ls, ls -l -t -a | tail

10. locale gets its data from environmental variables
    I read man locale

11.
downcase-dwim                 M-x ... RET
   Downcase words in the region, if active; if not, downcase word at
   point.
downcase-region               C-x C-l
   Convert the region to lower case.  In programs, wants two
   arguments.
downcase-word                 M-l
   Convert to lower case from point to end of word, moving over.

emacs, C-h a downcase

12.
reverse regular expression search C-M-r
regular expression search C-M-s
transpose sexps C-M-t
Move up in parenthesis structure C-M-u
scroll other window C-M-v

emacs, C-h-c to look up commands

13.
It is bound to C-g.

(keyboard-quit)

Signal a 'quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

emacs, C-h c to look up keystrokes, C-h f keyboard-quit

14.
It is bound to C-y, <S-insertchar>, <S-insert>, <menu-bar> <edit>
<paste>.

(yank &optional ARG)

Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.

I used C-h f yank

15. They seem to be almost the same. emacs dired gives information about the 
current "." and parent ".." directories

I used C-h f dired to learn about the command and C-x d to execute

cd /usr/bin ls -l
