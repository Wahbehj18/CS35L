I plugged my beagle bone in and it wasnt recognized by my computer.
I went to office hours to try and do the flash software update, but that
did not work. I ended up borrowing someone else's beagle bone


Set up
-----

plugged it in and clicked on START.htm and went to the webpage and
downloaded BONE_D64. I tried to install the drivers but it didnt work. I
had to restart my computer and disable driver signatures on my laptop.
Once that started working I installed the drivers and was able to use putty
with 192.168.7.2 and username root.

# connmanctl
# enable wifi
# scan wifi
# services
# agent on
# connect wifi_2cf7f106a1ed_426561676c65426f6e65303130373739_manageone
# quit 

I opened up connmanctl and scanned for wifi. Then, I connected to my 
partner's beagle bone's wifi and he connected to his iPhone hotspot.

My partner was Valentin Lagunes

He did # ifconfig so I can use his ip address : 170.20.10.3



Server
-------

Create a public/private key pair

# ssh-keygen

root@beaglebone:~# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
/root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
c2:54:9b:65:40:58:97:7e:c0:2d:3a:ea:1b:65:e3:a8 root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|       +=o+o     |
|      .. *= .    |
|      . oo o     |
|     o  o . .    |
|      o.S. .     |
|      .* .       |
|     .o .        |
|     ...         |
|    E ..         |
+-----------------+

Then I created an account for Valentin on my beagle bone
and gave him a passwd

# sudo useradd -d /home/val -m val
# sudo passwd val
	Password: lagunes

Created a .ssh directory in the directory for my partner
and gave him all the permissions and ownership

# sudo mkdir /home/val/.ssh
# cd /home/val
# sudo chown -R val .ssh
# sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Now the server was set up, so I logged on to his beagle bone and vice versa




Client
---------

generate key pair again

# ssh-keygen

copy key to my partner's ip and added ssh agent so I can log in

# ssh-copy-id -d jacob@170.20.10.3
# eval $(ssh-agent)
# ssh-add

ssh in to his beagle bone

# ssh jacob@170.20.10.3

Create a file and input random sentence so he can view it on his device

nano ayyy.txt

Once finished I checked his beagle bone directory and the file was 
successfully saved!!



Next I tried running programs with x11 forwarding

# ssh -X jacob@170.20.10.3
# firefox

however, it said the x11 forwarding was off which I could not figure 
how to fix.
