1. Even if the other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the
network in the lab exercise, the network would still be secure because of 
ssh (secure shell). It provides a secure channel over a unsecured netowrked 
by using encrypting and authentication. 

(1) If the other team tapped into my keyboard and copied my keystrokes, they 
still would not be able to hack in because we used password-free 
authentication due to the private keys we generated.

(2) If we booted off USB and the other team managed to gain access to USB, 
the network might not be secure since they would have access to the .ssh
directory we created and all the private keys we created.



2. The gp2 --verify command doesnt actually verifify the creator of the file
because it only checks that the file matches the corresponding signature. To
fix this problem, we could use a third party like Certificate Authority to 
keep track of all the files people create and the signatures generated.
