1.
$ emacs hw9.txt
keep log

2. 
$ git checkout -b quote v3.0

checkout directory with tag v3.0 and make a new branch called quote


3. 
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

Applied patch to new branch. Ran with no errors


4.
Learn the change log command

The Emacs command C-x 4 a adds a new entry to the change log file for the 
file you are editing (add-change-log-entry-other-window). 
If that file is actually a backup file, it makes an entry appropriate 
for the file's parentâ€”that is useful for making log entries for 
functions that have been deleted in the current version.


5. 
Add appropriate change log

$ emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt
C-x 4 a

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt: We created this patch in regards to the GNU
        changes which stated that quotes should be look 'like this' instead
        of `like this'. However we made the changes only to character string
        constants in .c files and not in comments or other places
C-x C-c

This change log accurately shows what happened in our patch.


6.
$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

Adds the files to the index and then commit changes
-F argument adds a file (ChangeLog) to the commit message

Similar to the Lab step we will use git format-patch to create a new
patch file and save the stdout into the file.

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

My TA said to use myself as the 'partner'

$ git checkout -b partner v3.0

Verify ChangeLog

$ make distdir

new directory diffutils-3.0.1-44b1 was created
